# lsl-minimum-height-checker
A script with hover text display to keep track of agents in a region who's height does not meet a set requirement

Simply create an object and place this script inside to get working.
Change the minimum height at the top of the script.

0.2m is added to the height of agents because the havok implimentation in secondlife adds ~.11m to every side of a physics bounding box
This is easily tested in game
